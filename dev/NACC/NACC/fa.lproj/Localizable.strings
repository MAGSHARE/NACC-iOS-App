/**
 MAIN LOCALIZATION FILE
 
 This file contains all the strings that are displayed in the NACC app.
 
 The app is designed to be entirely localizable, so no strings are included
 in the main app. Instead, we use keys and the NSLocalizedString function to
 develop the displayed strings. Whatever is written here, will be displayed
 in the app.
 
 It is important that this file be UTF-8 encoded. Xcode has a bug, where it keeps
 saving these as UTF-16. If this happens, you will see a bunch of upside-down
 question marks (Â¿) displayed, if viewed in Xcode. It will probably display fine
 in other text editors.
 
 You localize these strings by changing the string in the RIGHT side of the "=".
 
 DO NOT CHANGE THE LEFT SIDE!
 
 Only change the string on the right.

/**
 These TEXT- strings are used to build a natural-English sentence, and are displayed
 by a certain set of rules:
 
 1) All cleantime responses have 4 different numbers:
 1.1)    Total Days.
 This is the total number of days that the user has been clean.
 
 1.2)    Years
 The number of years (measured by date) that the user has been clean.
 
 1.3)    Months
 The number of months into the year that the user has been clean (not total months -just months after the last year).
 
 1.4)    Days
 The number of days into the month that the user has been clean (not total days -just days after the last month).
 
 For example, a user may have (This can vary, depending on the year selected):
 
 Total Days = 11476
 Years = 31
 Months = 5
 Days = 3
 
 Now, we need to display this in a string that is easy to read, and follows proper rules.
 
 In order to do this, we build the string in pieces.
 
 The first part of the string is the "introduction." It is displayed for all results:
 
 "You have been clean for"
 
 The next part is for Total Days. The app appends the Total Days to the string (We add a space):
 
 "You have been clean for" + " " + "11476"
 
 We then add either "day" or "days", depending on whether there are 1 or >1 days:
 
 "You have been clean for" + " " + "1" + " " + "day"
 "You have been clean for" + " " + "90" + " " + "days"
 
 After that, we decide if there are more than 90 days, or 90 days or less.
 
 If it is 90 days or less, we end the string there by attaching an exclamation point:
 
 "You have been clean for" + " " + "90" + " " + "days" + "!"
 
 If you look at the string keys below, this will be:
 
 "TEXT-1" + " " + "1" + " " + "TEXT-DAY-SINGULAR" + "TEXT-4-EXCLAMATION"
 
 We stop, there.
 
 If it is more than 90 days, then we will be adding more to it, so we append a comma:
 
 "You have been clean for" + " " + "11476" + " " + "days" + ","
 
 We then add "which is":
 
 "You have been clean for" + " " + "11476" + " " + "days" + "," + " " + "which is"
 
 We then add the years, months and days, adjusting for singular or plural:
 
 "You have been clean for" + " " + "11476" + " " + "days" + "," + " " + "which is"+ " "
 + "31" + " " + "years" + "," + " " + "5" + " " + "months" + " " + "3" + " " + "days" + "!"
 
 If you look at the string keys below, this will be:
 
 "TEXT-1" + " " + "11476" + " " + "TEXT-DAYS-PLURAL" + "TEXT-5-COMMA" + " " + "TEXT-3-WHICH"+ " "
 + "31" + " " + "TEXT-YEARS-PLURAL" + "TEXT-5-COMMA" + " " + "5" + " " + "TEXT-MONTHS-PLURAL"
 + " " + "3" + " " + "TEXT-DAYS-PLURAL" + "TEXT-4-EXCLAMATION"

You enter your cleandate by touching the big white button, then the calculator will tell you how long you have been clean in total days.\n\nIf you have more than 90 days, then you will also be told how many years, months and days you have been clean.

Along with the cleantime report, the app will display a lovely chain of hand-crafted Recovery keytags. You have the option of having the 'granite' Decade (10 years) keytag, and the purple Decades (20 years) keytag. You may also have the purple keytag awarded for every decade after twenty years.

If you choose to remember the cleandate, then your cleandate will be remembered between runs of the app.

You can also have the date picker prevent selecting dates before NA started, and after today.

If you choose, you can have the keytags scroll by tilting the device ('gravity scroll'). Otherwise, you scroll by dragging your finger up and down in the keytag display.
