DESCRIPTION
-----------
This is an Xcode (4, but written to support 3) project of an iOS (iPhone/iPod Touch/iPad) project that implements a native app of the popular NA Cleantime Calculator (NACC), which is a JavaScript-based Web app available here:

    http://magshare.org/blog/nacc-the-na-cleantime-calculator/

The concept is simple: Enter your cleandate, and a congratulatory message will be displayed, along with a scrolling "KeyTag Chain." If the date is an anniversary, then congratulations are in order, and the app is delighted to say so.

REQUIREMENTS
------------
This is an iOS app, made for iPhones and iPads. It is only available via the Apple App Store, and is free.

The code in this repository was developed on Apple Xcode 4.0.2, on a Mac running 10.6.8. It *should* work on somewhat older version of Xcode and the OS.

The spec uses Omni Group OmniGraffle. It's cool. Get it here:
